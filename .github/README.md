## Description

Observatory is a powerful beatmap manager which uses osu! API and popular beatmap mirrors to prioritize speed and efficiency. It provides data "on demand" and saves it locally to avoid unnecessary API calls, thus saving time and resources.

## Features

-   [x] **Plug and Use**: Just compile the docker image and run it. No need to worry about dependencies.
-   [x] **Don't fret about rate limits**: Rate limits are handled by the application, so peppy or beatmap mirror's owners won't get angry at you.
-   [x] **Fastest wins the race**: The application is designed to prioritize the fastest API's first to provide the best experience.
-   [x] **Long and reliable memory**: The application saves the data in database to avoid unnecessary API calls, also including TTL (time-to-live) for the data to be reliable
-   [x] **Everyone loves caching**: We also have a caching layer between the requests and our database, which allows processing requests _very_ quickly
